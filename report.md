## üìà Hot-Swap Technology

- **Priority Order:** Original `channel playlist.m3u` ‚Üí moj ‚Üí dlive
- **Target File:** `channel playlist.m3u` (only this file gets modified)
- **Backup Sources:** 2 external M3U files with priority system
- **Testing Strategy:** Backup streams are only tested when needed (during swap attempts)
- **Matching Strategy:** Exact name match first, then fuzzy matching
- **Verification:** Each backup URL is tested in priority order before replacement
- **Prevention:** Same backup URL won't be used twice

## üìà Geographic Notes

- Tests run from **GitHub Actions infrastructure** (multiple global locations)
- "Access Denied" errors may indicate geo-restrictions
- Hot-swap uses alternative sources that may have different geographic availability
- DNS errors suggest the streaming service may be down entirely
- Timeout errors often indicate server overload or slow response

## üìù Technical Details

- **User-Agent:** Modern browser simulation for better compatibility
- **Timeout:** 15 seconds per stream, 10 seconds for backup verification
- **Method:** HEAD request first, then GET with stream verification
- **Hot-Swap Logic:** Download backup sources ‚Üí Match channel names ‚Üí Test alternatives ‚Üí Replace URLs
- **File Modification:** Only `channel playlist.m3u` is modified with working alternatives
