## Enhanced Configuration Notes

- **VOD Checking:** Disabled - URLs ending with #.mkv are VOD files
- **PPV/Event Checking:** Disabled - UK EVENTS & USA EVENTS groups automatically detected
- **FAST Checking:** Disabled - Groups containing 'FAST' automatically detected
- **Geographic Headers:** Automatic region detection from group names with fallback headers
- **Rate Limiting:** 5 streams per batch with 2.0s delays and exponential backoff
- **Timeout:** 10 seconds per stream (PPV channels get 2x timeout)

## Manual Testing Options

To test specific content types:
1. Go to **Actions** → **Check M3U Streams (Enhanced)** → **Run workflow**
2. Toggle **Check VODs** to test video-on-demand content
3. Toggle **Check PPV** to test Pay-Per-View channels
4. Toggle **Check FAST** to test Free Ad-Supported TV channels
5. Adjust **Batch Size** (lower = slower but more reliable)
6. Adjust **Base Delay** (higher = less rate limiting)

## Enhanced Features

- **Rate Limiting Protection:** Exponential backoff for 429 errors
- **Geo-aware Headers:** Region-appropriate headers based on stream groups
- **Fallback Headers:** Try US/UK headers for geo-blocked content
- **Batch Processing:** Configurable batch sizes with adaptive delays
- **Random Jitter:** Prevents synchronized requests
- **Enhanced Error Categorization:** Better failure analysis
